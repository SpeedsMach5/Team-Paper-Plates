## Background

Fraudulent paper license plates have become an increasing problem on our roadways. This fraud costs the state of Texas roughly $125 million in registration fees per year. From September 2020 to 2021 Ft Bend County Toll Road Authority experienced 968,688 vehicles with fraudulent paper license plates, TxDOT experienced 772,724 vehicles with fraudulent license plates and Harris County Toll Road Authority experienced 412,285 vehicles with fraudulent paper license plates

In response to this crisis Team Paper Plates proposes to leverage block chain technology to address the lack of safeguards and verifications within the current system and to improve state revenue collection. The project:

> Aims to transform a vehicleâ€™s VIN# into a public key on a permissioned black chain with the intent to prevent the issuance of non-valid temporary paper license plates.
> Creating a verification method for initial issuance of temporary paper license 
plates tied to the vehicle VIN# and a denial of valid status for all subsequent issuance of temporary paper license plates to the associated VIN#. 
> Valid temporary paper license status will be printed to the license plate encoded in a QR code for scanning by law enforcement leveraging existing license plate reader technology currently being used by law enforcement agencies and toll authorities, as security feature.
